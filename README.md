# Offline-Reinforcement-Learning-for-Autonomous-Driving-FATE-Aligned-
This project simulates Offline Reinforcement Learning (OfflineRL) for autonomous driving using pre-recorded driving sequences and expert trajectories. It incorporates Batch-Constrained Q-Learning principles and includes fairness-aware reward shaping, inspired by Microsoft's FATE framework.
